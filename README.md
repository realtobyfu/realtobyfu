### Hi I am Tobias 👋

I am currently learning React.js, SwiftUI, and Natural Language Processing.
This year, I look forward to making more Mobile & Web Applications!

I also aim to launch an annoymous social media platform called 'Karma Farm' by the end of 2025.
Please reach out to me at 📫 3tobiasfu@gmail.com if woud like to learn more about my project or collaborate

In the future, I want to create more mobile / web apps that can make mundane tasks enjoyable. My ideas range from personal finance management App to an App where people can share what they have been cooking lately, or a notetaking App that brings more fun to daily life, but there is still a long way to go! 
**realtobyfu/realtobyfu** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
